### KIRABITER (bot1)

uses a period (.) for commands.

Kirabiter is a bot I made for simply wanting to make one, but it slowly grew and now I'm adding more and more to it. I've added several commands, see either in .help or code. .help hides a command(s), which is .adminpanel.

### ENIGAMI (bot2)

uses a exclamation point (!) for commands.

enigami is a bot I made, which I jokingly used [r34](rule34.xxx) API as a test, but it ended up as a wanted command, so I made this as a NSFW bot, instead of having it in the main bot.

### enikami - enigami extended (bot3)

uses a dollar sign ($) for commands.

enikami is another NSFW bot, but this time with timer support. Only for Rule34, currently.
