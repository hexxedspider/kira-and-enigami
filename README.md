# ANNOUCEMENTS

I am currently working on a selfbot, however it has my token hard coded (since i didnt make it with github in mind) but i might clean it up and release that under its own repo.

# KIRABITER (bot1)

Kirabiter is a bot I made for simply wanting to make one, but it slowly grew and now I'm adding more and more to it. I've added several commands, see either in .help or code. .help hides a few commands, one of which being .adminpanel, however you could always peep the code to find out yourself.

Uses a period (.) for commands.

## ENIGAMI (bot2)

enigami is a bot I made, which I jokingly used [r34](rule34.xxx) API as a test, but it ended up as a wanted command, so I made this as a NSFW bot, instead of having it in the main bot. smh.

Uses a exclamation point (!) for commands.

## enikami - enigami extended (bot3)

enikami is another NSFW bot, but for different commands this time.

Uses a dollar sign ($) for commands.

## Satin (satin)

Satin a new type of bot that plays from [BadRadio](badradio.nz) in a voice channel of your choosing. Go support BadRadio and their efforts, as it's easily one of the best things I've ever stumbled across.

# _MISC_

Each command prefix can be configured the bot1.py file.
Simply change out the symbol in the command_prefix to change what it'd reply to.


```bot = commands.Bot(command_prefix=".", intents=intents, help_command=None)```

The other two bots use slash (/) commands, so I don't think it'd really matter, but still.

These bots were made with ***my*** servers / me in general in mind, not public use. Sounds weird considering it's here on GitHub, but I mainly added this part so
1. I get something to do.
2. style points :P
